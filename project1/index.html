                    I am a second year Game Design and Development Student at RIT.
                    I enjoy playing and designing games, playing and composing music and practicing martial arts.
                    I have been coding for 6 years now and have experience coding C#, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                     as well as coding in a team, leading a project, and using remote repositories.
                    I am hoping to secure a Co-op in Game Design, Computer Science, or Software Engineering.

                <h3>Lycoris</h3>
                <p>
                    Lycoris is a personal project I did with one other person over the course of a couple months. 
                    It is a vertical slice of a metroidvania game created in GameMaker Studio 2 where we completely fleshed out core game mechanics as well as everything in the first few areas.

                <h3>Breadwinner</h3>
                <p> 
                    Breadwinner was a solo project where I created a short and simple puzzle platformer in GameMaker Studio 2 over the course of a week.
                    The goal of this project was to learn how to use Game Maker Language and to improve my level designing skills all while creating a complete game experience. 
                    While this project is relatively simple, I am proud of it as it is cohesive and polished.

                <h3>Sword Rush</h3>
                <p> 
                    Sword Rush was an academic project I did in a Game Development class over a semester in a team of 4. 
                    The project was done in C# Monogame with the use of GitHub remote repositories as a means of doing collaborative coding.
                    The game is a top-down action rougelike where the objective is to clear as many rooms as possible by defeating all the enemies in each room.
                    The gimick? You are only able to move by lunging forward with an attack.
                    Defeating enemies grants you EXP which helps you level up. When you level up, you pick from 3 randomly assigned attributes to upgrade such as attack damage, attack speed, or health.
                    Defeating enemies and opening chests can also grant you gold. You can use this to purchase powerful equippable powerups in the shop on the main menu.
                    these powerups include a dodge, sheild, and lifesteal. 
                </p>
