        The goal of this website is to display my projects in a projessional and eye catching manner. My audience would be prospective employers which is what influences my design.
        The look of the site is supposed to look clean and sophistocated, while also being visually eye catching and interesting.

    <h1>General Notes</h1>
    <pre>
        -diagonal gridboxes image formatting is hard
            -unskew the image first
            -size the image larger than the container
            -layer the images behind the gridbox with overflow:hidden
            -I wanted to make the image in the about me section slanted on both sides, but I was unable to find a method to be able to do that within css
        -embedding the pdf is very janky, this is the best I can make it look
            -i cant keep it skewed because the formatting would be off
            -the best I can do while the grid is skewed is just make it small
        -idk why but sometimes the text is blurry and there doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it
    </pre>
