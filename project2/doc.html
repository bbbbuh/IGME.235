    <p>Above is a mockup of the general site layout in both a desktop and mobile layout. 
        While the final product is slightly different in terms of navigation control placement, 
        the general idea is largley the same.</p>

    <p>
        I wanted to create dropdown checklists as one of my controls because I wantedthe controls to be clean and compact without the amount of options offered affected.
        This source helped me figure out the code to allow me to do this.

        Development Notes
    </h2>
    <p>
        I really wanted to use dropdown checklists for my controls on this project because I felt that there were too many options for them to all be on screen at once. This really condensed my design and made readability of the controls much better. Additionally I find that the responsiveness of this project is good as I was able to add a breakpoint that allow the navigation to be used while on mobile screens. The grid of cards and navigation bar use css grid and flexbox respectively which helps a lot with readability and space usage. Lastly I added the ability to click and hold on a card to zoom in on it. Initially I had the card zoom in when hovering, but I found that this way give you a lot more control of how you are able to see the cards and can be helpful for people who can't see as well.

        Grade
    </h2>
    <p>Overall I think that this project deserves at least a B, there are spots in the code that I could definitely clean up, and my visuals could also use some improvement.</p>
