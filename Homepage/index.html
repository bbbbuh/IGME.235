            Hello, my name is Joshua Leong, a second year Game Design and Development Student. 
            I enjoy playing and designing games, playing and composing music and practicing martial arts.
            From this class I hope to be able to have a solid foundation in web development to one day be able to use in a profession.
            Whether that be related to game development or not, the skills learned from this class are good to have when entering the tech industry at large.
            From my major and time at RIT, I hope to be able to secure a job at a game development company in some facet, ideally a lead or level designer.
        </p>
