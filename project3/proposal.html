			<h1><em>Little Armys</em></h1>
			
			<section>
				<h2>I. High Concept</h2>
				<p>One-liner (or up to 3 sentences) synopsis that pitches and summarizes your game.</p>
				<p>A small grid based tactical strategy game where the player controls units and aim to defeat an enemy army.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>II. Genre</h2>
				<p>Identify the gameplay genre(s) the game belongs to. This may also be mentioned in the High Concept section above.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Tactical Strategy</li>
					<li>Turn-Based</li>
					<li>Top-Down</li>
					<li> Puzzle </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>III. Platform</h2>
				<p>Desktop only (mobile if time permits)</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>IV. Story</h2>
				<p> Particular story, simply puzzle solving.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>V. Esthetics</h2>
				<p>Pixel art units and terrain. Varied randomly generated terrain. </p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>VI. Gameplay</h2>
				<p>On the player's turn they will be able to move all their units based on their movement speed, choose to attack the enemies if they are in range.
					The game is grid based so the unit range, movement, and terrain are all restricted to the grid.
					Battles are based on the unit's stats such as attack, defense, critical chance, avoidance, speed, etc.
					The turn player's units always attack first.
					The enemy units are controlled by AI but are able to do all the same actions.
				</p>
				<h3>Mechanics</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Units may have unique actions such as healing, or pushing other units.</li>
					<li>Terrain may have unique properties such as lowering movement speed, preventing certain units from moving, etc.</li>
					<li>Units may also have unique attributes such as being able to move through difficult terrain or attack from a distance.</li>
				</ul>
		
				
				<h3>Control</h3>
				<p>Be specific, here are many of the options:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Keyboard and/or mouse</li>
					<li>Touch and/or gesture (Mobile only)</li>
					<li>Accelerometer (Mobile only)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"</h3>
				<p>How is the player taught how to play the game? Is this integrated into the gameplay, are there separate instructional scenes, a tutorial, or some combination? Is 
				it obvious to the player how to play the game? See <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/25/scvngr-game-mechanics/"><cite>Cascading Information Theory</cite> on the SCVNGR game mechanics page.</a></p>
			
				<h3>Player learning</h3>
				<p>Explain some of what the player needs to learn to beat the game. Be specific and cite actual powerups, combos, and strategies. Here we are talking about <i>depth</i> - which is simply (according to Extra Credits) "the number of emergent experientially different possibilities (or meaningful choices) that come out of one ruleset."</p>
				
			</section>
			
			
			<section>
				<h2>VII. Screenshots</h2>
				<p>Have at least 2 mockup screens of the game. They can be hand drawn and scanned, Photoshop mockups, or scanned <a href="http://gamestorm.tumblr.com/">doodles</a>  - use  &lt;img&gt; tags. You can either display the images in this section, or somewhere else on the page.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>VIII. Other</h2>
				<p>Something else you'd like to say that doesn't fit elsewhere. Also discuss any external libraries you might use. All libraries are subject to Professor approval.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>IX. About the developer(s)</h2>
				<p>Your name/major/minor/year your, skill set and interests (ex. programming, game physics, graphic design, Maya, Photoshop, Illustrator, music, game sound, ...).</p>
